[['Mayans',
"An ancient Mayan practice after a victorious battle was to gather the weapons and clothes of their fallen foes.  The Mayans intended to conquer the enemy's villages after the battle to seize the land for their own.  If the villagers were able to recognize Mayan warriors approaching, they could flee and strike back at a later time.  How did the Mayans prevent this?"],
['Plants',
"Carnivorous plants eat insects.  Insects do not naturally approach these plants; instead the insects are drawn to the scent of rotting animal flesh.  Some carnivorous plants all have the ability to emit chemicals into the air that mimic particular smells.  How do the plants get their food?"],
['Queen',
"The Queen knew to be careful, so she had her food sampled by the royal taster before she would partake.  However, her enemies came to know that the queen had an insatiable appetite for a rare type of nut.  These enemies also learned that the royal baker was sympathetic to their cause.  What might the conspirators do to assassinate the queen?"]],

[['DDOS',
"Internet attacks are becoming an increasingly difficult problem for organizations that operate websites.  They are often used when individuals become dissatisfied with the actions of a governmental or corporate entity.  The goal of one such attack is to overwhelm a website's ability to connect to other users by constantly requesting information.  Organizations have since learned to block internet addresses that send very high quantities of redundant requests.  How do individuals get around this defense and continue to use this method?"],
['Commander',
"A tank corps commander and his forces remained loyal to the civilian government after it lost power.  As he planned the counterattack to restore the government, the commander felt he could only succeed if he captured the military headquarters; a compound situated in the middle of a lake, reachable only by way of several, narrow pontoon bridges.  Each bridge was so unstable that only a few tanks could cross at once - a force too small to overcome the defenses.  What plan can the commander follow to successfully capture the compound?"],
['Oil Well',
"An oil well exploded and caught fire.  The result was a blazing inferno that resisted all initial efforts to extinguish the burning oil.  Elite firefighters were dispatched.  They planned to dump a huge amount of fire retardant foam on the fire.  When they arrived they realized that the small hoses they brought could not shoot the foam quick enough to do any good.  How can the firefighters change their plan to extinguish the blaze?"]

[['Store',
"Two women who run a beachside gift shop make almost all of their money during the summer season.  However, they have expenses all year long that require having funds on hand.  What do they do to make sure they have enough money throughout the year despite only bringing in income during the summertime?"],
['Flight',
"Nearly all birds have the ability to fly.  Flight allows birds to migrate long distances and nest in places that ground dwellers cannot reach.  In order fly, the birds must be relatively lightweight.  Bones are the heaviest part of an organism, and ordinary bones would make flight difficult.  How can birds have bones and still be able to fly?"],
['Phones',
"Cellular telephone calls require a set of conditions to be met in order to transmit a person's voice from one phone to another.  One of the biggest reasons that calls fail is because the phone falls out of range from a tower.  This can happen when the signal is blocked by mountains or large buildings.  How might cellphone providers decrease the frequency of dropped calls?"]

[['Viceroy',
"The viceroy butterfly is a nontoxic creature that has no natural defenses.  Monarch butterflies have deadly toxins and distinctive patterns that mark the toxicity and scare predators from eating them.  If the viceroy cannot evolve toxins, what can it do so that predators fear it like the monarch butterfly?"],
['Artillery',
"During the war a large contingent of soldiers were stranded in an area vulnerable to an attack from the sky.  They had no defenses to protect themselves from air attack.  The soldiers did have several broken anti-aircraft weapons that would appear to be functional from the cockpit of a plane.  What can the soldiers do to minimize the possibility of being attacked from the air?"],
['Birds',
"Certain rare species of birds have the ability to mimic the sounds of the predators that live in their environment.  These birds have no natural defenses to counter the attacks of predators.  What can the birds do to protect themselves when predators are nearby?"]

[['Waitstaff',
"A town has an annual festival that draws in many thousands of people to local restaurants and businesses.  This creates a challenge for the local restaurants because the large quantity of customers can quickly overwhelm the regular employees that work during the rest of the year.  This problem is further complicated by the fact that the population of the town is not large enough to sustain the many service industry employees that are needed during the peak business season.  What can the restaurant owners do to address this problem?"],
['Bank',
"Banks have to keep a certain amount of money on hand for their customers.  Customers and investors can lose faith in the solvency of a bank if it fails to have enough cash to honor withdrawals, even if the bank has enough capital to cover them.  When a bank is seen as insolvent it is more likely that the bank's customers will make a 'run' on the bank or empty their accounts in exchange for cash or precious metals.  If this cycle continues, it can destroy a bank.  What can banks do to stop this cycle when their solvency is in question?"],
['PubTrans',
"Regions with large populations are constantly faced with transportation issues.  They must provide reliable transportation because their infrastructure cannot handle the presence of a car for every citizen.  Complicating this even further, city and county governments face chronic budget shortfalls and must save money wherever they can.  If individuals have to wait for their train or bus for long periods, such as in the case of rush hour, they will be motivated to drive their cars.  How do public transportation agencies handle this problem?"]

[['Mayans',
"An ancient Mayan practice after a victorious battle was to remove and wear the distinctive clothing of their enemy. Dressed in the clothing of the deceased, they would enter enemy territory. From a distance, families and loved ones of the deceased believed their loved ones were entering home from battle; it was not until the Mayans were too close that their fatal mistake was realized."],
['Plants',
"Carnivorous plants often emit a stench mimicking that of rotting flesh to attract their prey. Maggots are drawn towards the stench of their regular feeding ground - a dead corpse - and are then devoured by the plant. "],
['Queen',
"The Queen knew to be careful, so she had her food sampled by the royal taster before she would partake. However, her enemies came to know that the Queen had an insatiable appetite for a rare type of nut. The enemies influenced Her Majesty's favorite baker to send the Queen a precious chocolate containing the rare nut filling and also a deadly poison. The Queen joyously popped the treat in her mouth all at once. The treat would be her last."]],

[['Aquarium',
"An aquarium has decided to create a display of a famous sunken ship and its surroundings, the deep and frigid waters of the northern Atlantic Ocean.  A replica ship with plants and animals found near the shipwreck were placed in the tank but, surprisingly, the dark environment made it impossible for visitors to see the ship, the main point of the exhibit.  Putting lights inside the ship looked too artificial and pointing one powerful spotlight on the ship disrupted the feeding habits of the fish.  The aquarium has decided to use many, low-powered lights simultaneously to light the exhibit."],
['Coup',
"A tank corps commander and his forces remained loyal to the civilian government after it lost power in a coup d'etat.  As he planned the counterattack, the commander felt he could only succeed if he captured the military headquarters; a compound situated in the middle of a lake, reachable only by way of several, narrow pontoon bridges.  Each bridge was so unstable that only a few tanks could cross at once - a force too small to overcome the defenses.  In the end, the commander positioned groups of tanks at each bridge and ordered them to attack at the same instant."],
['Oil Well',
"An oil well exploded and caught fire.  The result was a blazing inferno that resisted all initial efforts to extinguish the burning oil.  Elite firefighters were dispatched.  They planned to dump a huge amount of fire retardant foam on the fire.  When they arrived they realized that the small hoses they brought could not shoot the foam quick enough to do any good.  In a change to the plan, men were stationed in a circle and foam was directed at the fire from all directions, striking it at once and extinguishing the blaze. "]

"During the war a large contingent of soldiers were stranded in an area vulnerable to an attack from the sky. With no other defense they decided to use the surrounding debris to create objects that would appear to be anti-aircraft weaponry from a plane. When a fighter plane passed over the camp, it went into evasive maneuvers and the men below were spared."],

When a bank is seen as insolvent it is more likely that the bank's customers will make a 'run' on the bank or empty their accounts in exchange for cash or precious metals.  If this cycle continues, it can destroy a bank. That is why it is very important for the bank to anticipate the possibility of a run and have enough cash on hand to meet the demands of customers."],
['Movement',
"Large-scale social changes happen much less frequently than one might expect.  At the outset of a social movement, there may only be a handful of individuals willing to spend their time and money to promote a particular cause.  It has often been the case that the work of these individuals motivates others who would have been less likely to become involved in the movement. The key to success for a social movement is mobilizing people from many different walks of life and increasing the visibility of their cause. "]
