['Mayans',
"An ancient Mayan practice after a victorious battle was to gather the weapons and clothes of their fallen foes.  The Mayans intended to conquer the enemy's villages after the battle to seize the land for their own.  If the villagers were able to recognize Mayan warriors approaching, they could flee and strike back at a later time.  How did the Mayans prevent this?"],
['Plants',
"Carnivorous plants eat insects.  Insects do not naturally approach these plants; instead the insects are drawn to the scent of rotting animal flesh.  Some carnivorous plants all have the ability to emit chemicals into the air that mimic particular smells.  How do the plants get their food?"],
['Queen',
"The Queen knew to be careful, so she had her food sampled by the royal taster before she would partake.  However, her enemies came to know that the queen had an insatiable appetite for a rare type of nut.  These enemies also learned that the royal baker was sympathetic to their cause.  What might the conspirators do to assassinate the queen?"],

['Viceroy',
"The viceroy butterfly is a nontoxic creature that has no natural defenses.  Monarch butterflies have deadly toxins and distinctive patterns that mark the toxicity and scare predators from eating them.  If the viceroy cannot evolve toxins, what can it do so that predators fear it like the monarch butterfly?"],
['Artillery',
"During the war a large contingent of soldiers were stranded in an area vulnerable to an attack from the sky.  They had no defenses to protect themselves from air attack.  The soldiers did have several broken anti-aircraft weapons that would appear to be functional from the cockpit of a plane.  What can the soldiers do to minimize the possibility of being attacked from the air?"],
['Birds',
"Certain rare species of birds have the ability to mimic the sounds of the predators that live in their environment.  These birds have no natural defenses to counter the attacks of predators.  What can the birds do to protect themselves when predators are nearby?"]]

['Mayans',
"An ancient Mayan practice after a victorious battle was to gather the weapons and clothes of their fallen foes.  The Mayans intended to plunder their enemy's village after the battle to seize more valuables.  If the villagers were able to recognize Mayan warriors approaching, they could hide their treasures or flee with them.  How did the Mayans prevent this?"],
['Plants',
"Carnivorous plants eat insects, but they need a way to catch their food without being able to move from their spot.  The insects do not naturally approach these plants;  instead the insects are drawn to the scent of rotting animal flesh.  The carnivorous plants come in various sizes, shapes, and colors, but what they all have in common is the ability to emit chemicals into the air that mimic particular smells.  How do the plants get their food?"],
['Critic',
"A food critic has become so well-known that she can no longer do her job.  The staff at the best restaurants know her by sight.  If she is spotted, the staff and chef will make every effort to impress her.  Of course, the food critic is supposed to evaluate how the restaurant serves an ordinary customer, not a special one.  In order to judge the restaurants fairly, what can the famous food critic do?"],

['Store',
"Two women who run a beachside gift shop make almost all of their money during the summer season.  However, they have expenses all year long that require having funds on hand.  What do they do to make sure they have enough money throughout the year despite only bringing in income during the summertime?"],
['Flight',
"Nearly all birds have the ability to fly.  Flight allows birds to migrate long distances and nest in places that ground dwellers cannot reach.  In order fly, the birds must be relatively lightweight.  Bones are the heaviest part of an organism, and ordinary bones would make flight difficult.  How can birds have bones and still be able to fly?"],
['Phones',
"Cellular telephone calls require a set of conditions to be met in order to transmit a person's voice from one phone to another.  One of the biggest reasons that calls fail is because the phone falls out of range from a tower.  This can happen when the signal is blocked by mountains or large buildings.  How might cellphone providers decrease the frequency of dropped calls?"]]
