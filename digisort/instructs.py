[['Mayans',
"An ancient Mayan practice after a victorious battle was to gather the weapons and clothes of their fallen foes.  The Mayans intended to conquer the enemy's villages after the battle to seize the land for their own.  If the villagers were able to recognize Mayan warriors approaching, they could flee and strike back at a later time.  How did the Mayans prevent this?"],
['Plants',
"Carnivorous plants eat insects.  Insects do not naturally approach these plants; instead the insects are drawn to the scent of rotting animal flesh.  Some carnivorous plants all have the ability to emit chemicals into the air that mimic particular smells.  How do the plants get their food?"],
['Queen',
"The Queen knew to be careful, so she had her food sampled by the royal taster before she would partake.  However, her enemies came to know that the queen had an insatiable appetite for a rare type of nut.  These enemies also learned that the royal baker was sympathetic to their cause.  What might the conspirators do to assassinate the queen?"]],

[['Shed',
"The shed was burning fiercely by the time the alarm was sounded. Within minutes, dozens of neighbors had arrived on the scene with buckets that could be filled quickly at the nearby lake.  As they worked, they grew increasing concerned that the fire would spread to other houses.  The small buckets of water evaporated quickly, providing little headway in the fight.  What can the individuals do to stop the fire?"],
['Oil',
"An oil well exploded and caught fire. The result was a blazing inferno that resisted all initial efforts to extinguish the burning oil.  Elite firefighters were dispatched.  They planned to dump a huge amount of fire retardant foam on the fire. When they arrived they realized that the small hoses they brought could not shoot the foam quick enough to do any good. How can the firefighters change their plan to extinguish the blaze?"],
['Coup',
"A tank corps commander and his forces remained loyal to the civilian government after it lost power in a coup d'etat.  As he planned the counterattack, the commander felt he could only succeed if he captured the military headquarters; a compound situated in the middle of a lake, reachable only by way of several, narrow pontoon bridges.  Each bridge was so unstable that only a few tanks could cross at once--a force too small to overcome the defenses.  What plan can the commander follow to sucessfully capture the compound?"]

[['Store',
"Two women who run a beachside gift shop make almost all of their money during the summer season.  However, they have expenses all year long that require having funds on hand.  What do they do to make sure they have enough money throughout the year despite only bringing in income during the summertime?"],
['Flight',
"Nearly all birds have the ability to fly.  Flight allows birds to migrate long distances and nest in places that ground dwellers cannot reach.  In order fly, the birds must be relatively lightweight.  Bones are the heaviest part of an organism, and ordinary bones would make flight difficult.  How can birds have bones and still be able to fly?"],
['Phones',
"Cellular telephone calls require a set of conditions to be met in order to transmit a person's voice from one phone to another.  One of the biggest reasons that calls fail is because the phone falls out of range from a tower.  This can happen when the signal is blocked by mountains or large buildings.  How might cellphone providers decrease the frequency of dropped calls?"]

[['Viceroy',
"The viceroy butterfly is a nontoxic creature that has no natural defenses.  Monarch butterflies have deadly toxins and distinctive patterns that mark the toxicity and scare predators from eating them.  If the viceroy cannot evolve toxins, what can it do so that predators fear it like the monarch butterfly?"],
['Artillery',
"During the war a large contingent of soldiers were stranded in an area vulnerable to an attack from the sky.  They had no defenses to protect themselves from air attack.  The soldiers did have several broken anti-aircraft weapons that would appear to be functional from the cockpit of a plane.  What can the soldiers do to minimize the possibility of being attacked from the air?"],
['Birds',
"Certain rare species of birds have the ability to mimic the sounds of the predators that live in their environment.  These birds have no natural defenses to counter the attacks of predators.  What can the birds do to protect themselves when predators are nearby?"]

[['Lakes',
"Constant-level lakes are difficult to maintain.  Dams are used to keep the water level stable in lakes.  At the 'top' of a lake, a dam can release water to raise the water level; a dam at the 'bottom' can release water if the level is high or retain water if it is low.  Keeping lakes as high as possible is important for tourism income but it also bears a high cost - if the surrounding area gets heavy rainfall the lake can flood and cause extensive property damage.  How can the level of the lake be maintained safely?"],
['Metal',
"A company has begun using an unconventional metal for the manufacture of its computer parts.  Electronics made from this metal are identical to more costly metals but they require sustained heat to solder (or connect) them to other pieces.  This is difficult for the company because their equipment cannot sustain the necessary heat.  An employee recently outfitted some existing equipment to generate enough heat but it overheats quickly.  What can the company do to use its existing equipment with the new metals?"],
['Refuel',
"It requires extensive backing from outside support teams to explore underdeveloped landscapes like those in Antarctica or deep underwater.  One particularly challenging aspect of this exploration is the need for fuel in very remote locations.  This is because thousands of gallons of fuel can be needed to run equipment but the weight of this fuel seriously limits the mobility and efficiency of any expedition.  How do people address this problem?"]
