[['Mayans',
"An ancient Mayan practice after a victorious battle was to gather the weapons and clothes of their fallen foes.  The Mayans intended to conquer the enemy's villages after the battle to seize the land for their own.  If the villagers were able to recognize Mayan warriors approaching, they could flee and strike back at a later time.  How did the Mayans prevent this?"],
['Plants',
"Carnivorous plants eat insects.  Insects do not naturally approach these plants; instead the insects are drawn to the scent of rotting animal flesh.  Some carnivorous plants all have the ability to emit chemicals into the air that mimic particular smells.  How do the plants get their food?"],
['Queen',
"The Queen knew to be careful, so she had her food sampled by the royal taster before she would partake.  However, her enemies came to know that the queen had an insatiable appetite for a rare type of nut.  These enemies also learned that the royal baker was sympathetic to their cause.  What might the conspirators do to assassinate the queen?"]],

[['DDOS',
"Internet attacks are becoming an increasingly difficult problem for people with websites online.  It seems that attacks occur when one or more individuals becomes dissatisfied with a group or organization with a presence online.  Attackers often try to knock their target's website off the internet by overwhelming it with information.  People have learned to block computers that send unreasonable amounts of information.  If attacks like this are still successful today, how are the attackers beating the blocking strategy?"],
['Commander',
"A tank corps commander and his many forces remained loyal to the civilian government after it lost power.  As he planned the counterattack to restore the government, the commander felt he could only succeed if he captured the military headquarters; a compound situated in the middle of a lake and reachable only by way of several narrow pontoon bridges.  Each bridge was so unstable that only a portion of his forces could cross at once - a portion too small to overcome the defenses.  What plan can the commander follow to successfully capture the compound?"],
['Oil Well',
"An oil well exploded and caught fire.  The result was a blazing inferno that resisted all initial efforts to extinguish the burning oil.  Elite firefighters were dispatched.  They planned to dump a huge amount of fire retardant foam on the fire.  When they arrived they realized that the type of hose they brought could not shoot the foam quick enough to do any good, even though they had way more hoses than they could use. How can the firefighters change their plan to extinguish the blaze?"]

[['Store',
"Two women who run a beachside gift shop make almost all of their money during the summer season.  However, they have expenses all year long that require having funds on hand.  What do they do to make sure they have enough money throughout the year despite only bringing in income during the summertime?"],
['Flight',
"Nearly all birds have the ability to fly.  Flight allows birds to migrate long distances and nest in places that ground dwellers cannot reach.  In order fly, the birds must be relatively lightweight.  Bones are the heaviest part of an organism, and ordinary bones would make flight difficult.  How can birds have bones and still be able to fly?"],
['Phones',
"Cellular telephone calls require a set of conditions to be met in order to transmit a person's voice from one phone to another.  One of the biggest reasons that calls fail is because the phone falls out of range from a tower.  This can happen when the signal is blocked by mountains or large buildings.  How might cellphone providers decrease the frequency of dropped calls?"]

[['Viceroy',
"The viceroy butterfly is a nontoxic creature that has no natural defenses.  Monarch butterflies have deadly toxins and distinctive patterns that mark the toxicity and scare predators from eating them.  If the viceroy cannot evolve toxins, what can it do so that predators fear it like the monarch butterfly?"],
['Artillery',
"During the war a large contingent of soldiers were stranded in an area vulnerable to an attack from the sky.  They had no defenses to protect themselves from air attack.  The soldiers did have several broken anti-aircraft weapons that would appear to be functional from the cockpit of a plane.  What can the soldiers do to minimize the possibility of being attacked from the air?"],
['Birds',
"Certain rare species of birds have the ability to mimic the sounds of the predators that live in their environment.  These birds have no natural defenses to counter the attacks of predators.  What can the birds do to protect themselves when predators are nearby?"]

[['Waitstaff',
"A town has an annual festival that draws in many thousands of people to local restaurants and businesses.  This creates a challenge for the local restaurants because the large quantity of customers can quickly overwhelm the regular employees that work during the rest of the year.  This problem is further complicated by the fact that the population of the town is not large enough to sustain the many service industry employees that are needed during the peak business season.  What can the restaurant owners do to address this problem?"],
['Bank',
"Banks have to keep a certain amount of money on hand for their customers.  Customers and investors can lose faith in the health of a bank if it fails to have enough cash to fulfill withdrawals, even if the bank could get the money soon.  When a bank is seen as unhealthy it is more likely that the bank's customers will make a 'run' on the bank and try to empty their accounts in exchange for cash or precious metals.  If this cycle continues, it can destroy a bank.  What can banks do to stop this cycle when their health is in question?"],
['PubTrans',
"Regions with large populations are constantly faced with transportation issues.  Providing reliable transportation is a must because traffic would be terrible if each citizen tried to drive their own car.  Complicating this further, city and county governments frequently face budget shortfalls and must save money wherever they can.  When people are forced to wait or can't go where they want they will be more likely to drive their cars.  Considering that it is a necessity to provide effective transportation and do it at the lowest cost, how do public transportation agencies handle this problem?"]

[['Mayans',
"An ancient Mayan practice after a victorious battle was to remove and wear the distinctive clothing of their enemy. Dressed in the clothing of the deceased, they would enter enemy territory. From a distance, families and loved ones of the deceased believed their loved ones were entering home from battle; it was not until the Mayans were too close that their fatal mistake was realized."],
['Plants',
"Carnivorous plants often emit a stench mimicking that of rotting flesh to attract their prey. Maggots are drawn towards the stench of their regular feeding ground - a dead corpse - and are then devoured by the plant. "],
['Queen',
"The Queen knew to be careful, so she had her food sampled by the royal taster before she would partake. However, her enemies came to know that the Queen had an insatiable appetite for a rare type of nut. The enemies influenced Her Majesty's favorite baker to send the Queen a precious chocolate containing the rare nut filling and also a deadly poison. The Queen joyously popped the treat in her mouth all at once. The treat would be her last."]],
