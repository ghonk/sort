['Mayans',
"An ancient Mayan practice after a victorious battle was to gather\n\
the weapons and clothes of their fallen foes. The Mayans intended to\n\
plunder their enemy's village after the battle to seize more valuables.\n\
If the villagers were able to recognize Mayan warriors approaching, \n\
they could hide their treasures or flee with them. How did the Mayans\n\
prevent this?"],
['Plants',
"Carnivorous plants eat insects, but they need a way to catch their\n\
food without being able to move from their spot. The insects do not\n\
naturally approach these plants; instead the insects are drawn to\n\
the scent of rotting animal flesh. The carnivorous plants come in\n\
various sizes, shapes, and colors, but what they all have in common\n\
is the ability to emit chemicals into the air that mimic particular\n\
smells. How do the plants get their food?"],
['Critic',
"A food critic has become so well-known that she can no longer do\n\
her job. The staff at the best restaurants know her by sight. If\n\
she is spotted, the staff and chef will make every effort to\n\
impress her. Of course, the food critic is supposed to evaluate\n\
how the restaurant serves an ordinary customer, not a special one.\n\
In order to judge the restaurants fairly, what can the famous food\n\
critic do?"],

['Store',
"Two women who run a beachside gift shop make almost all of their\n\
money during the summer season. However, they have expenses all\n\
year long that require having funds on hand. What do they do to\n\
make sure they have enough money throughout the year despite only\n\
bringing in income during the summertime?"],
['Birds',
"Nearly all birds have the ability to fly. Flight allows birds to\n\
migrate long distances and nest in places that ground dwellers cannot\n\
reach. In order fly, the birds must be relatively lightweight.  Bones\n\
are the heaviest part of an organism, and ordinary bones would make\n\
flight difficult. How can birds have bones and still be able to fly?"],
['Phones',
"Cellular telephone calls require a set of conditions to be met in \n\
order to transmit a person's voice from one phone to another. One of\n\
the biggest reasons that calls fail is because the phone falls out of\n\
range from a tower. This can happen when the signal is blocked by\n\
mountains or large buildings. How might cellphone providers decrease\n\
the frequency of dropped calls?"]]
